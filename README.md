# Movie-Watchlist-organizer
csc 102 project - Connor Pirkl &amp; Zachary Sabatino
The goal of this project is to create a simple program that allows users to manage a list of movies theyâ€™ve watched or want to watch. Users can add movie titles, genres, personal ratings, and indicate whether they've watched the movie. The program will display visual graphs of genre preferences and watched/unwatched ratios. This project is designed to use key programming concepts like dictionaries, object-oriented programming, file handling, error handling, and GUI development.
